Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a true tech and personal finance geek. My full time job involves consulting with large, international banks on software and business architecturing. Outside of work, my passion projects revolve around personal finance (see [Honeybee Podcast ](https://anchor.fm/honeybee-podcast)). 

As a certified Associate Wealth Planner *(AWP-CFPÂ®)*, I enjoy sharing unbiased, grounded personal finance tips and property investing analysis (Singapore Real Estate).
