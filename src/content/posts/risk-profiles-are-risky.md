description: The Purpose of Investment Risk Profiles is to take stock of your risk appetite. But what if risk profiles themselves pose a risk on their own?

If you've invested in anything before, you would have come across something called the "Risk Profile Questionnaire."

 A Risk Profile Questionnaire is a series of questions meant to measure your risk tolerance and time horizon in investing. The questionnaire is designed to show which type of investment products and investment strategies or approaches may be most suitable for you. Usually, the answer to each question is given a point that ranges anywhere from 1 to 5. The total score of the questionnaire would then suggest the appropriate risk profile for you.

There are no right or wrong answers, and you're usually encouraged to follow your instincts and answer the questions. 

In a previous blog post of mine, I introduced the relationship between Risk and Return [(read it here!)](https://www.cherietan.com/risks-and-returns-explained). However, how we quantify risk is subject to our own experiences (or the lack of). Although the key to successful investing lies in understanding your risk appetite and managing your risks appropriately, a simple questionnaire will not be able to capture the nuances of your risk preferences. A series of questions will not accurately prepare you for the gains and losses that your investments may incur.

The first time I encountered a risk profile questionnaire was way before I even understood anything about the financial markets. It was a strange concept to me back then that a stock brokerage would make financial product recommendations based on a series of pre-set questions and answers.

## Risk Profile Questionnaires Need to Evolve, Too.

While financial products in the markets have been evolving rapidly, the risk profiling system remained relatively the same. With complex products flooding the market and the millennial generation becoming more interested in growing their wealth, it could lead to a disastrous cocktail of doom. Ultimately, risk profile questionnaires today are still inadequately developed to capture one's actual risk appetite. 

## When 30% risk profiles could be an aggressive, moderate, or conservative risk profile (and anything in-between really.)

Deciding how much risk to stomach in your investment plans is a huge decision that will significantly impact your savings and ability to retire. Recall the last time you received the results of your risk profile questionnaire. Are you able to accept a gain/loss of 30%? Perhaps. It sounds reasonable when you compare it to the more aggressive category with a range of a gain/loss of around 60%. 30% loss also seems like it could get you much more on your investment when compared to the more conservative category with a range of a gain/loss of approximately 10%.

But what if I changed the scenario and told you that the most aggressive profile might have a gain/loss of 30%, a moderate risk profile might have a gain/loss of 20%, and a conservative risk profile might have a gain/loss of 10%? You would likely pick the moderate risk profile with a gain/loss of 20% in this scenario.

**Misleading, isn't it?**
 
 Are you starting to understand why risk profile questionnaires are not an accurate measure of your true risk appetite? Your risk profile range that a questionnaire generated has absolutely nothing to do with the real risk you can stomach. It's all relative to what's considered aggressive and conservative, based on the score card's pre-determined values.

## Taking It In Your Own Hands

Start by figuring out how your life might look like with various investment returns based on the risk level you're planning to take.

Questions about the acceptable range of loss fail to address the concern of not reaching your investment goals at the end of the investment period. With every investment, there's always the potential of biting off more than you can chew. As such, it's essential to know how much you can potentially afford to lose and how this loss would impact your investment outcome.

#### Ask yourself, "Am I going to be alright with losing 30% of all of my investments? How will this impact my desired goal, e.g., starting a family / living a comfortable retirement life? " 

When you invest, you're trading the risk of losing X% of capital for a potential upside of Y%. No questionnaire can help you fully comprehend how much you're willing (or financially able) to lose. 

**Figure out which tradeoffs you are (and aren't) ready to make, then plan your investments and asset allocation accordingly.**

Take your risk profile questionnaire results with a pinch of salt.
